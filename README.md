For my SBA 316 at Per Scholas, I decided to do a Hangman game implementing CSS, HTML and Javascript. The game includes an in-game keyboard which players must use to guess the word correctly.
The player has up to 6 wrong guesses they can make before getting the game over screen. If the player guesses correctly, the player resets with a new word and hint to figure out.
This project is a prime example of using the Document Object Model as well as the Browser Object Model, and how they help with designing projects.
